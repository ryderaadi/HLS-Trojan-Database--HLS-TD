# HLS-Trojan-Database-(HLS-TD)
The HLS-Trojan database consists of 77 instances corresponding to several benchmarks [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] such as CNN convolutional layer IP datapath, finite impulse response (FIR) filter IP datapath, MESA IP datapath, infinite impulse response (IIR) filter IP datapath, discrete cosine transform (DCT) IP datapath, and sharpening filter (SF) IP datapath. Further, the database consists of 21 extracted features for each benchmark from their respective Trojan infected (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5 and I6) and non-infected (NI) IP RTL designs. The first row depicts the different features name. Finally, the last column shows the label (Trojan infected -1/2/3/4/5/6, and non-infected - 0). The labels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 corresponds to performance degradation hardware Trojan [3], denial of service hardware Trojan [3], battery exhaustion hardware Trojan [2], downgrade attack hardware Trojan [2], functional hardware Trojan [4], and Time-Bomb HLS Trojan [6], respectively.
